> Mobile Application for Managing Grocery Using React Native and TensorFlow Image Recognition


------------------------------

## Introduction

This project utilized image recognition to streamline accounting of purchased foods into a grocery management system.  It also tracked food items that were consumed or otherwise removed from the refrigerator or pantry.  Together, these are the two main functions that make up a grocery management platform that will help people know what foods they have at home and plan their grocery shopping such that it minimizes food waste.
